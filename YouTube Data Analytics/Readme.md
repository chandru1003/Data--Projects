**Synopsis:**

<p>The proposed project idea is to develop a web page that allows users to input YouTube video links or keywords and retrieve information about the video's title, views, likes, number of comments, and perform sentiment analysis on comments using the YouTube API. The data will be presented visually in the form of statistics, such as charts and graphs, to provide users with an easy-to-understand overview of the video's performance and audience feedback.</p>

<p>The current state of the project involves fetching data from YouTube API and writing it into a CSV file names youtube_data.csv.</p>
